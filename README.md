# WiESPlayer
Music player based on ESP32 and Wi-Fi interface using webbrowser

Mp3 Player: The core of our release is a simple Mp3 player that automatically loops back to the beginning of the playlist when it's finished.

Web Controls: No more fiddling with tiny buttons! Our player is controlled from a convenient web interface. Here, you can navigate between tracks (previous, next), toggle play/pause, and adjust the volume.

OTA Updates: The device software can be updated Over The Air (OTA) without the need for wires or complex procedures.

Manage Tracks: Via the web interface, you can easily upload new mp3 tracks or delete old ones from the device.

Flexible Wi-Fi Connectivity: The device can create its own Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) for direct control, or it can connect to your home (global) Wi-Fi for broader access.
